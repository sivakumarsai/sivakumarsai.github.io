		  <p>The Sophex seminar is a seminar run by first-year mathematics graduate students at UT Austin that is designed to be a safe space for first-year students to practice speaking and to facilitate getting to know each other. This is achieved by only letting first and second-year students attend talks. Below are all of the titles and abstracts of talks from the academic year 2024-2025, followed by a guide on how to run the seminar.</p>
		  
		  <p>Typically, the Sophex seminar meets on Fridays from 4:00PM to 5:00PM in the 12th floor classroom, followed by dinner at a nearby location.</p>

		<h1>Fall 2024</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt>09/06:	Mark Saving</dt>
			<dd>The Constructive Multiverse</dd><br>
			<dd>Whiz through the wild, wacky worlds of constructive mathematics. In these mad models, anything is possible; all real-valued functions can be continuous, calculus can be developed through the theory of infinitesimals, computers can calculate any function you like, and schemes are just plain old local rings. All this and more can be yours for the low-low price of throwing away logical laws and axioms undergirding the majority of modern mathematics! Just pay separate processing and handling.</dd>
			
			<dt>09/13:	Sai Sivakumar</dt>
			<dd>Fourier analysis on LCA groups and Pontryagin Duality</dd><br>
			<dd>We will recover from representation theory the classical Fourier transforms on the circle group and on the real line, and time permitting, briefly talk about Pontryagin duality. Topics to be discussed are irreducible unitary representations of locally compact Abelian groups, their characters, the dual group, the Fourier transform, Pontryagin duality, and Fourier inversion.</dd>
			
			<dt>09/20:	Jemma Schroder</dt>
			<dd>Hybrid Optimal Control Problems in a Stochastic Environment</dd><br>
			<dd>We present a question of optimal route planning in R^2 with time-penalized direction changes in a stochastic environment. We will begin with a single actor, then introduce multi-actor interaction dynamics, and time permitting we will consider the addition of cooperative team-based interactions in a game-theoretic framework.</dd>
			
			<dt>09/27:	Ansel Goh</dt>
			<dd><no title></dd><br>
			<dd>In this talk, we will be analyzing (watching) the adventures of panda warrior. With a stunning rating of 10.0 (mod 8.3) on IMDB, we answer a question posed by Sai: “is it skibidelicious and better than rent a girlfriend?” Come join us as we examine the best thing to come out of China since Zimao and the Chinese Remainder theorem.</dd>
			
			<dt>10/04:	Ioannis Karagiorgis</dt>
			<dd>A deep dive into math drama</dd><br>
			<dd>The only thing more interesting than math is math drama. In this talk, we’ll be doing a deep dive into the life of one of the most controversial characters in the MCU (Mathematics Cinematic Universe). Expect a story full of betrayals, rivalries, and bitter feuds between mathematicians. Who is this character you ask? Tune in on Friday to find out!</dd>
			
			<dt>10/11:	Unai Caja Lopez</dt>
			<dd>Surprise talk</dd><br>
			<dd>The contents of Friday’s talk will be a surprise. However, I will say that the following elements will make an appearance:<br>
			• Prisoner’s dilemma<br>
			• Cheating in relationships<br>
			• Vampire bats</dd>
			
			<dt>10/18:	John Teague</dt>
			<dd>Opinions Were Like Kittens</dd><br>
			<dd>Opinions — we all have them. Some have more opinions than others, and they take great joy in sharing them. In this Sophex talk, we will explore some particular opinions had by particular people. As such, this will be an interactive talk.</dd>
			
			<dt>10/25:	Daniel Koizumi</dt>
			<dd>On a technique to solve deeper problems</dd><br>
			<dd>As a mathematics PhD student, you’re surely familiar with the urge to acquire useless superpowers. In this talk, we will examine another, with some mind paid toward a quote by Grothendieck. Applying our newfound power, we will also examine whether descent is the correct way to solve exciting problems. We will end with finding bounds on the depth of a certain class of objects.</dd>
			
			<dt>11/01:	Flavio Argentieri</dt>
			<dd>Opinions Are Back</dd><br>
			<dd>I enjoyed John's talk so much, that I thought it deserved a sequel. I am very curious to collect your (anonymous) opinions on a variety of hot topics - even though some of them might have been hot 1000 years ago, and they are at best tepid now. This will be an interactive talk, so please bring a mobile phone. If, for some reason, you are unable to, Sai will provide one.</dd>
			
			<dt>11/15:	Sai Sivakumar II</dt>
			<dd>Video games I care about</dd><br>
			<dd>Video games have been a large part of my life. In this talk I will discuss a few of them that have been very important to me and I would like to hear from the audience about other video games that were significant to them. Time and technology permitting, I will play some of these games.</dd>
			
			<dt>11/22:	Zimao Tian</dt>
			<dd>O, P, E, R, A</dd><br>
			<dd>So, what is OPERA?<br>
			One fine day we'll see, from every Mediterranean melody, the hidden sob of a heart pulsing with longing.<br>
			Punch sir, I punch your nose, what followed your knockdown was a century of iridescent shrieks and shattered beauty.<br>
			Ever just a dream, can't be true that we are together, together for all time till eternity, fervor and mastery.<br>
			Rejoice everyone smiles from somewhere, but no one will come to me, hands around my waist, tire me out with passionate embrace, my desolated land, steeped in grimness, deep as a bowl of black wheat wine; "poor wounded name, my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee…"<br>
			Always you, every thought I'll ever know, everywhere I'll go you'll be, you and me; rise with me, Amor Americano!<br>
			P. S. There are melodies accompanying each of some beginning words, i.e. an opera behind each of the five verses above. Even more - five countries, five styles.</dd>
			
			<dt>12/06:	Jake Wellington + Matt Verheul</dt>
			<dd>You Decide</dd><br>
			<dd>Matt and I will give a presentation based off of YOUR slides! Send in your wackiest, craziest slides you can imagine and we will stretch them into a talk. 2/3 slides per person should be appropriate.</dd>
