		  <p>Video games have profoundly shaped the way I think. Below are some games I like, listed in no particular order.</p>

		<h1>Sound Voltex</h1>
		<p>Sound Voltex is a Japanese (vertically scrolling) rhythm game developed by Konami. Attached below is a clip I recorded from one of my sessions:</p>
		<div align="center"><iframe width="540" height="960"
		src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaVvZRL7fDY">
		</iframe></div>
		<p>There are four white buttons for the white notes and two orange buttons below the white buttons for the orange notes. There are also two knobs: the left one is for the blue laser and the right one is for the pink laser.</p>
		<p>The goal of the game is to hit the notes and the lasers as they arrive at the judgement bar on the bottom of the screen as precisely as possible. The player chooses a song at some difficulty, and the the notes/lasers are arranged in a manner that complements the song, which plays while the notes/lasers scroll downwards (the specific arrangement of notes/lasers constitutes a "chart"). Each song has three to four charts of different difficulties ranging from 1 (the easiset) to 20 (the hardest).</p>
		<p>Sound Voltex determines how precisely the player hits the notes/lasers with the following timing windows: ERROR (missed notes), NEAR (±150.0 ms), CRITICAL (±41.6 ms), S-CRITICAL (±20.8 ms). Hitting notes increases the player score, and S-CRITICALs award the same number of points as CRITICALs.</p>
		<p>This game has an excellent selection of music, the visual style is stimulating and clean, and the charts are high quality (in some sense the collection of charts is curated, and effort goes into making them). I started playing Sound Voltex in August 2024.</p>
		<h1>Minecraft</h1>
		<p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game developed my Mojang Studios. Attached below is a clip I recorded from a long time ago...:</p>
		<div align="center"><iframe width="639" height="360"

		<p>There are many ways to play Minecraft, but there are two primary "modes" the game provides by default. In Survival mode, players spawn in a world with natural resources around them that they must extract and use to survive from hunger, monsters that come at night, and nature itself. A common goal players have is to defeat the Ender Dragon as part of their quest to progress. In Creative mode, players have access to the full palette of blocks and entities present in Minecraft and can build whatever they please. In both modes there is some invisible impetus for creativity and self-expression.</p>
		<p>While not being the first sandbox game, Minecraft has had a lasting impact on the gaming community and popular culture due to its unique style, relative accessibility, and its user-generated content. There is a vast collection of mods, servers, player skins, texture packs, shader packs, custom maps, player-built contraptions, merchandise, YouTube videos, and even a <a href="https://youtu.be/EY4h38NaXwU">movie</a> that chronicle Minecraft's success and ubiquity in gaming culture.</p>
		<p>My Minecraft account was made on June 21, 2013 at 1:14:51 PM. In the early years, I was briefly interested in redstone creations before spending quite a few years playing with command blocks. In later years, I developed an interest in playing modded Minecraft, and playing Minecraft with friends in Survival mode. Nowadays I do not play often, but it has always been a dream of mine to create a dungeon crawler experience in Minecraft.</p>
