		<h1>Sound Voltex</h1>
		<p>Sound Voltex is a Japanese rhythm game developed by Konami. It is specifically a vertically scrolling rhythm game. Attached below is a clip I recorded from one of my sessions:</p>
		<div align="center"><iframe width="540" height="960"
		src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDO_CxdN51E">
		</iframe></div>
		<p>There are four white buttons for the white notes and two orange buttons below the white buttons for the orange notes. There are also two knobs: the left one is for the blue laser and the right one is for the red laser.</p>
		<p>The goal of the game is to hit the notes and the lasers as they arrive at the judgement bar on the bottom of the screen as precisely as possible. The player chooses a song at some difficulty, and the the notes/lasers are arranged in a manner that complements the song, which plays while the notes/lasers scroll downwards. Each song has three to four charts of different difficulties ranging from 1 (the easiset) to 20 (the hardest).</p>
		<p>Sound Voltex determines how precisely the player hits the notes/lasers with the following timing windows: ERROR (missed notes), NEAR (hit notes too early or late), CRITICAL (±42ms), S-CRITICAL (±21ms). Hitting notes increases the player score, and S-CRITICALs award the same number of points as CRITICALs.</p>
